<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>I strive to be honest in all I do. Whether in casual conversation or in critical scenarios, I believe that honesty
is always the best policy. Employers, employees, colleagues, and customers can all rely on me to tell the truth.</p>
<h3>Work Ethic</h3>
<p>I have been raised to work hard at whatever I do. No matter how trivial the job, I work at it until I get it done.
However, I will not bang my head against a brick wall. If I need to take a break from a task I've been working, on, I
find something else useful to do.</p>
<h3>Practicality</h3>
<p>Cool gadgets are all well and fine, but if they don't serve a useful purpose, I have no use for them. The same goes
for programs. I will not buy something I will not use. I believe in a distraction free, productive workplace.</p>
<h3>Professional Conduct</h3>
<p>In my normal, everyday life, you'd be hard pressed to hear me utter a curse word. I strive every day to remain
courteous and polite. So, when it comes to the work place, I find it easy to remain professional. I also work to remain
hygienic and well dressed at all times, as I do not wish to cause others discomfort.</p>
