<h3>Computer Operations</h3>
<p>For much of my life, I've been fascinated with computers. This fascination has lead to a high level of technical
competency, and a natural skill I have chosen to hone over the years. If I am presented with an unfamiliar piece of
software, I am able to pick up the basics in short order, and advanced features are only a little work away. In addition,
a high level of understanding in the area of computer science allows me to picture the underlying architecture that
remains hidden from view. I am familiar with Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, and JetBrains products.7</p>
<h3>Application Programming</h3>
<p>My aforementioned skills in discerning underlying computer architecture have served me well in learning how programs
are built. I have learned, in multiple languages, how to build a user application, with either a graphical user
interface, or a command line interface. My current languages are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Lua</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux Proficiency</h3>
<p>Due to my time spent at Zane State, I've learned how to use the Linux operating system in several forms. I am able to
utilize both a command line and a graphical user interface with Linux. I enjoy using Linux even more than I enjoy using
Windows operating systems, though I am more than proficient with both. I am also capable of using Bash scripting to
automate tasks in Linux.</p>
<h3>Windows Server Proficiency</h3>
<p>Though not my server software of choice, I am aware and able to utilize the vast capabilities of the Windows Server
operating systems. I am familiar with Windows Server 2012 at this time. I am trained in using PowerShell to automate
tasks.</p>
<h3>Web Design and Site Deployment</h3>
<p>As you can see from this site, I am capable of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to put together a website. If you know
what you want the site to look like, I can make it come to life. When the site is made to your specifications, I can
deploy it to a server of your choosing. At this time, I am only familiar with Google Cloud Services, but that can change
in as little as a few days, whether you prefer Amazon Web Serveces, Microsoft Azure, or hosting the site in house, I can
make it happen.</p>
<h3>Network Design and Maintenance</h3>
<p>Given design specifications, I can come up with a network topology that will address your needs, accounting for such
factors as quality of service, voice over IP, wireless network coverage, access control, public facing servers, and many
more. Once the network is designed, I can obtain new hardware, or adapt existing hardware to the needs of the network.
Mantaining the network is also within my abilities. As needs change, I can update the network, maintaining a living
topological diagram that will document the network in its current state, as well as any changes I've made. I am familiar
with Cisco technology, but I have no doubt that I can learn to use other equiptment and software in short order.</p>
