My name is Patrick Shannon, and welcome to my CV. If you're here, you're probably an employer. In that case,
you probably want to know about me. I'd recommend starting with the 'Bio' tab in the top right. There, you'll find some
general background on me. Then, take a look at the 'Skills' and 'Experience' tabs to check out what I can do and what
I've done. If you're extra curious, you can find out what I do in my free time in the 'Interests' tab. Finally, you
don't have to take my word for any of this; you can check out the 'References' tab for a list of people that I trust to
tell you about me. If you want to contact me, the best way is by email. You can find that, along with other websites I
am a member of, and other places to contact me also in the 'Bio' tab.
