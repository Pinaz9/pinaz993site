I built this website from scratch specifically to serve as a CV. It was programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
using a program called <a href=http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>PyCharm</a>. It took me a few months month to knock this
together, and along the way, I learned about CSS and how to use it with HTML. If you want to learn HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, or any other programming language, I recommend <a href=http://www.codeacademy.com>Code Academy</a>.
They have free courses for a variety of languages, and all are easy to follow.
