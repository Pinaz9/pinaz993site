    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    My name is Patrick Shannon, and welcome to my CV. If you’re here, you’re probably an employer. In that case, You probably want to know about me. I’d recommend starting with the ‘Bio’ tab in the top right. There, you’ll find some general background on me. Then, take a look at the ‘Skills’ and ‘Experience’ tabs to check out what I can do and what I’ve done. If you’re extra curious, you can find out what I do in my free time in the ‘Interests’ tab. Finally, you don’t have to take my word for any of this; you can check out the ‘References’ tab for a list of people that I trust to tell you about me. If you want to contact me, the best way is by email. You can find that, along with other websites I am a member of, and other places to contact me also in the ‘Bio’ tab.
    <h3>About This Website</h3>
    I built this website from scratch specifically to serve as a CV. It was programmed using HTML and CSS (no real need for JavaScript at this point) using a program called <a href=http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>PyCharm</a>. It took me less than a month to knock this together, and along the way, I learned about CSS and how to use it with HTML. If you want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other programming language, I recommend <a href=http://www.codeacademy.com>Code Academy</a>. They have free courses for a variety of languages, and all are easy to follow.
